# Stack in Argo CD (App of Apps)
---

## 🧩 **1️⃣ The Core Idea — A “Stack” = A Group of Related Applications**

In **Argo CD**, a *stack* usually refers to a **logical grouping of applications** that together form a complete environment or service.

Think of it as a **collection of Argo CD Applications** managed together — for example:

```
Banking Stack (Dev)
├── frontend-app
├── backend-app
├── database-app
└── monitoring-stack
```

Each of those (frontend, backend, etc.) is a separate `Application` in Argo CD, but together they make up your **Dev stack**.

## 🧠 **2️⃣ Why “Stack” Matters in Argo CD**

Argo CD manages Kubernetes manifests from Git.
But large environments are made up of multiple components — databases, microservices, monitoring tools, etc.
Instead of deploying each manually, you can manage them as **a stack** for:

* Environment isolation (dev, stage, prod)
* Easier CI/CD control
* Rollback and promotion consistency
* DRY (don’t repeat yourself) GitOps structure

Let’s go step-by-step so you fully understand **how**, **why**, and **where** it’s used (with your GitHub setup included).

## 🧩 **1️⃣ What Is the App-of-Apps Pattern?**

**Definition:**
It’s a GitOps design pattern where **one Argo CD Application (the parent)** manages and deploys **multiple other Applications (the children)** — each of which represents a microservice, component, or subsystem.

In other words:

> You deploy *one parent YAML* → it automatically deploys several apps → each app manages its own Kubernetes manifests.

## 🧠 **2️⃣ Why We Use App-of-Apps**

| Reason                 | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧹 Centralized control | Manage multiple related applications (frontend, backend, DB) from one parent.           |
| 🔁 GitOps consistency  | Each child app can have its own repo or directory, but all changes still flow from Git. |
| 🔄 Automated syncing   | Parent auto-creates, updates, and prunes child apps.                                    |
| 🧩 Modular design      | You can reuse components (e.g., monitoring stack) across environments.                  |
